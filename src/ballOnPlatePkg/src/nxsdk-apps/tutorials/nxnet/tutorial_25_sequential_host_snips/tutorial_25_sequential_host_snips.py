Tutorial: tutorial_25_sequential_host_snips.py
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This tutorial demonstrates sequential host snips. Sequential host snips execute
either in the pre-execution phase (before the network executes on chip
un-interrupted) or the post-execution phase. When the network needs to sync
back to the host, it will cause delays so for the most performance critical
code, custom logic should be written as embedded snips and executed on lakemont
(embedded processor). However, when certain requirements like larger code/memory
sizes, memory handling, external communication or third party linkages are
necessary, host snips can be used to execute the custom code.

In this tutorial, we have 10 compartments with 10 input axons. Once the network
is configured, we run for 110 steps but in strides of 10. The input axon ids for
spike injection are read from a file by the pre-execution snip. For the first 10
steps, each compartment is injected spike in a round robin fashion. Upon finishing
10 steps, the post execution snip kicks in and changes the distribution to a normal
distribution with mean varying from 0 to 9 for steps of 10. The post execution snip
only kicks at the last timestep of the run. An embedded snip runs on every
timestep and injects the spike event to the input axon.

This tutorial also demonstrates the ability of host snips to read a file.
