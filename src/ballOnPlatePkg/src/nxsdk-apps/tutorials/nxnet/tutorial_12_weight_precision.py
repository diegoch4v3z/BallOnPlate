#
# This tutorial introduces synaptic weight precision. The weight precision
# is controlled by the number of wgtbits in synapseFmt (numWeightBits in
# ConnectionProtoype). We configure four connections each with a different
# synaptic weight. We illustrate the use of the synaptic numWeightBits to adjust
# the precision.

    compartment5 = net.createCompartment(compartment_prototype2)

    # Configure connection between compartment 1 and other compartments with
    # varying weights and weight precision.
    #
    # The weight used for spike accumulation can be specified by up to 8 bits.
    # For the first connection, the synaptic weight of 20 is used.
    #
    # Note on Synapse Format (nxcore implementation)
    #
    # Each logical core supports 15 different types of synapse formats where
    # each synpase format is a unique combination of numWeightBits, numDstBits,
    # compressionMode, signMode etc. Validation errors are flagged if the limit of
    # of 15 is exceeded per core.
    #
    # The synaptic format details the decoding configuration needed to
    # interpret the compressed synaptic data from SYNAPSE_MEM.

    # -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    # The numWeightBits field specifies the number of significant bits used for
    # the synaptic weight value. A value of -1 (7 using nxcore synapsefmt) maps to 8 bits,
    # thus keeping the full precision of the synaptic weight value.
    # Note, if the signMode is 1 (mixed), then the sign bit
    # is included in the weight value, thereby losing one more LSB.
    # The general mapping is the following:
    #      wgtShift = 8 - numWeightBits + isMixed
    #      wgt = (wgt >> wgtShift) << wgtShift
    # We configure 4 bits of precision for the first connection.
    # For this example, the first synapse has a synaptic weight of 20.
    # We want only the 4 most significant bits,
    # i.e. 0001 0100 --> 0001 0000 (16).
    #
    # -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    # -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    # The numDstBits (idxBits in nxcore API) field is the bit width of the compartment index value
    # ("idx") stored in synapse_mem that maps to the actual compartment
    # index CIdx stored in each synapse. CIdx is calculated by the
    # following: CIdx = idx * (CIdxMult+1) + CIdxOffset +cxBase
    # Valid values for numDstBits (idxBits) are 0..7 which map
    # to 0,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. Here, idxBits of 1 maps to 6.
    # -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    # -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    # Compression indicates how the synapses are compressed.
    # 0: sparse
    # 3: dense (shared index) uncompressed
    # -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    connectionProtoype1 = nx.ConnectionPrototype(weight=20, numWeightBits=4, compressionMode=0,
                                                 signMode=2)
    net._createConnection(compartment1, compartment2, connectionProtoype1)

    # connectionProtoype2 is almost identical to connectionProtoype1 but differs in weight and weight precision
    connectionProtoype2 = copy(connectionProtoype1)
    connectionProtoype2.weight = 16
    # numWeightBits of -1 signifies using full weight precision. Valid values are (-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8)
    connectionProtoype2.numWeightBits = -1
    net._createConnection(compartment1, compartment3, connectionProtoype2)

    # -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    # For the connections below, we also change the signMode
    # The signMode controls the sign of the synaptic weight and tag.
    # 1: mixed - no shared sign bit (included in each weight value)
    # 2: excitatory shared sign bit (0/+)
    # 3: inhibitory shared sign bit (1/-)
    # -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    # We configure 6 bits of precision for the third connection.
    # This connection has a synaptic weight of 10. For this synapseFmt we will
    # configure the mixed signMode (fanoutType), i.e. the sign bit is included
    # in the weight value. Therefore, we need to specify an extra signficant bit
    # to get a final weight value of 8.
    # For example, without the signed bit included when we
    # set numWeightBits to 5 we lose the 3 LSBs, 0000 1010 --> 0000 1000 (8).
    # However, when we configure mixed signMode we lose another LSB (4 total)
    # due to the inclusion of the sign bit, i.e. 0000 1010 --> 0 000 0000 (0).
    # Thus, in order to include the signed bit in the weight value (mixed fanout)
    # and get 8 as our final weight value we need to specify 6 bits, i.e.
    # 0000 1010 lose 2 LSB for precision --> 0000 1000 and 1 more LSB
    # for the sign bit --> 0 000 1000 (8).
