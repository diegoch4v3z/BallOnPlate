# Tutorial: tutorial_04_synaptic_delays.py
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This tutorial introduces synaptic delays and will demonstrate how they work
# and how to configure them. We configure four compartments driven by an input
# spike generator. The spike generator is connected to four other compartments
# through four synapses - each with a different synaptic delay.
# We inject three spikes from the spike generator (here at timesteps 5, 15,
# and 30).The first synapse has no synpatic delay, while the second,
# third, and fourth synapses have 12, 28, and 62 timestep delays respectively
# (these numbers are randomly chosen for illustration purposes).
# This tutorial also details the configuration of the balance between the
# synaptic delay precision and the number of dendritic compartments.

    # Configure the dendrite accumulator delay range using numDendriticAccumulators
    # This controls the balance between the delay resolution and the
    # number of dendritic compartments.
    # There are 2**13 dendritic accumulators. numDendriticAccumulators controls the
    # maximum number of delay buckets per compartment and therefore the
    # maximum number of addressable compartments. The number of delay
    # buckets is 2**numDecayExp-2 (due to HW implementation) and the number of
    # addressable compartments is 2**(13-numDecayExp).
    # As you allocate more bits for the delay
    # precision, there are less bits to address the dendritic compartment.
    # For example, here we configure the delayBits to be 6, giving us up
    # to 2**6-2=62 delay buckets per compartment and 2**7=128 compartments.
    # A delayBits value of 0 is interpreted as 1 and 7 is interpreted as
    # 6 (maximum supported). When delayBits is not set the default is 3,
    # thus there are 1024 compartments with 8-2=6 delay buckets.
    # Specify less delay bits in order to increase the number of
    # dendritic compartments and similarly specify more delay bits
    # in order to increase the synaptic delay resolution.
    #
    # Valid sizes for numDendriticAccumulators are [8,16,32,64]
