# Tutorial: tutorial_03_multiple_cores_with_bias.py
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This tutorial configures 4 compartments in separate cores and drives the
# voltage using only a bias current on one. There exists a bias driven neuron
# on source core, and three other neurons on different cores of the same chip.
#
# Spikes are sent from the neuron on source core to all other neurons which
# have different threshold voltages. On the source compartment, the current
# variable u takes a constant value of 0 since there are no incoming spikes
# and noise is disabled. The voltage variable v will grow due to the bias
# current and eventually spike when v crosses a threshold. v resets upon
# spiking and, since no refractory period is configured, immediately begins
# to increase again. The cycle repeats until the example completes. Note that
# when v resets after spiking it does not reset to 0 since v is reused for
# tracking the refractory period. Please see the tutorial on refractory delays
# for details. The spike from one neuron is transmitted to other neurons.
