This tutorial demonstrates using yarp ports with host snips.

Pre-requisites:

1. Install yarp. Follow: http://www.yarp.it/install_yarp_linux.html
    1.a For Xenial: sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://www.icub.org/ubuntu xenial contrib/science" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/icub.list'
    1.b sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 57A5ACB6110576A6
    1.c sudo apt-get update
    1.d sudo apt-get install yarp

2. Start yarpserver by running: yarpserver
    Ensure it comes up

3. On your machine, ensure you have CMake to build the host snip as we need to create the shared library with linkages
   to yarp libs

Tutorial is intended to currently run on Kapohobay based setup. Minor modifications to CMakeLists.txt and yarp setup
would be required in other scenarios.

Scenario:

Tutorial code is adapted from http://www.yarp.it/yarp_cmake_hello.html

In this tutorial, we create the following pipeline:

HostProcess (HostSnip) --------------->input channel---------------> EmbeddedSnip runSpiking (read from channel)
 reads /cx/in                                                              |
        ^                                                                  |
        |                                                                  V
        |                                                                Update
        |                                                                  |
        |                                                                  |
 writes /cx/out                                                            V
HostProcess (HostSnip) <---------------feedback channel<------------- EmbeddedSnip runSpiking (write to channel)

In the Host Snip, we connect the yarp output and input ports
yarp.connect(outPort->getName(), inPort->getName());

In thsi tutorial, we create a compartment group of size N and connect it using spikegen. Then using concurrent host
snip(HostProcess) pick a cx in round robin format, write it to ouputPort. Using yarp inputPort we read the cxId and
send spike to it by sending the id to EmbeddedProcess using NxSDK channels. From the embedded snip, monitor which cx
spiked, send the address of it along with the time stamp to the HostProcess.

Please note: HostProcess is a concurrent snip running in parallel with neurocore execution.
