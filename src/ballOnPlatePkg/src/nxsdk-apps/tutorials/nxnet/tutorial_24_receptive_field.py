""" Tutorial for constructing a neuron's receptive field with mixed synapses.

The goal of this tutorial is to implement a receptive field connectivity which
detects activity from a particular subset of N_t target neurons from a neural 
array of size N. It consists of a detector neuron which receives inhibitory 
synapses from the N_s surrounding neurons of the population to be tested. The
remaining N_t neurons excite the detector neuron. With a sensible choice of
weights, this connectivity implies that the neuron will only be active when the
target neurons are active and the rest are inactive.

    This function creates an NxNet network with two compartment groups, one 
    representing the observed population, and the other a single compartment
    detector. The later receives inhibitory and excitatory connections from the 
    observed population. The connectivity defines the detector's receptive field.

    Stochastic spike trains will stimulate each neuron from the observed 
    population. During the first half of the simulation time all neurons will
    receive such stimuli.For the last half of the simulation time Only the target
    neurons will receive stimulation. The detector neuron will then only be 
    active for the last half of the runtime.
