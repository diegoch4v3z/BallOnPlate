# Tutorial: tutorial_01_single_compartment_with_bias.py
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This tutorial configures a single compartment and drives the voltage using
# only a bias current.  The current variable u takes a constant value of 0
# since there are no incoming spikes and noise is disabled.  The voltage
# variable v will grow due to the bias current and eventually spike when v
# crosses a threshold.  v resets upon spiking and, since no refractory
# period is configured, immediately begins to increase again.  The cycle
# repeats until the example completes.  Note that when v resets after spiking
# it does not reset to 0 since v is reused for tracking the refactory
# period.  Please see the tutorial on refactory delays for details.
