# Tutorial:
# tutorial_02_single_compartment_with_bias_connecting_to_two_others.py
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This tutorial configures a single compartment and drives the voltage using
# only a bias current.  This compartment is then connected to two additional
# compartments, one through an excitatory synapse and one through an
# inhibitory synapse demonstrated via weights on the connections.
#
# Bias current driven compartment, i.e. compartment1:
# The behavior of the bias current driven compartment is described in tutorial
# 01.
#
# Compartment connected via excitatory synapse, i.e. compartment2:
# When compartment1 spikes at around t = 15, it causes the current for
# compartment2 to jump.  This results in the voltage for compartment2
# to increase and then spike.  The voltage then immediately begins to increase
# again since the current is still positive, though slowly decreasing.  The
# voltage reaches threshold and spikes again and the voltage again starts to
# increase.  Note that the rate of voltage increase after the second spike
# is slower than that after the first spike since the current value is
# decreasing.
#
# Compartment connected via inhibitory synapse, i.e. compartment3:
# When compartment1 spikes at around t = 15, it causes the current for
# compartment3 to jump to a negative value.  The voltage, since it is
# integrating the current, begins to decrease.  The current curve is concave
# up since the current value is returning to 0 over time.

    # The plot for compartment2 voltage appears to not always reach the
    # threshold of 640 when it spikes.  This is because when v crosses
    # the threshold during time step t, it gets reset immediately. Since the
    # monitor reads out the v value at the end of the time step, the
    # intermediate values are not visible from the plot.  Compartment1 voltage
    # is more consistent because it is only driven by a bias. Compartment2
    # receives time varying input and thus the last value below threshold is
    # always different and thus it appears to be spiking at different levels.
