""" Tutorial for noise utilization in spiking winner-takes-all circuits.

The goal of this tutorial is to demonstrate the use of noise injection 
into the membrane current (u) of single-compartment neurons for competition
between similar neurons in a population. For this, we build a network of 
N single compartment neurons forming a winner-takes-all circuit (WTA). In 
this configuration a single neuron, on average, will be firing while inhibiting 
the other, hence its name. The N neurons compete, and the winner takes over
the activity of all other N-1 neurons.

Without noise, a neuron can win because it fired first or because its firing
rate is the highest. In the case of a noisy WTA, as shown here, all neurons 
are allowed to be statistically equivalent. This means the choice of a winner
is random (pseudo-random in practice). When the WTA is part of a bigger system
this means no previous knowledge about the system needs to be encoded on the 
parameters of the WTA. It also avoids overfitting and allows the use of the WTA 
as a primitive for stochastic computations with spiking neurons.

We are going to probe the current and membrane voltage of each neuron in the
network. Probes will also be used to get the spike times for each neuron.

We build and compare two alternative WTA motifs:

1) A single inhibitory neuron mediating the competition between all N neurons.
   Here, the principal neurons connect with excitatory synapses to an auxiliary
   neuron. Depending on its input, the auxiliary neuron sends inhibitory
   feedback to the primary neurons. Size: N+1 neurons and 2N connections.

2) All-to-all lateral inhibition between the N principal neurons. In this case,
   we only use primary neurons which compete through all-to-all lateral
   inhibition. Size: N neurons and N**2 connections.

for each of these motifs a function will be defined, createWtaMotif1 and
createWtaMotif2 respectively.
