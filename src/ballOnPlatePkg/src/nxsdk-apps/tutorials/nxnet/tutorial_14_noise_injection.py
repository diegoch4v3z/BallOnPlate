# Tutorial: tutorial_14_noise_injection.py
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The goal of this tutorial is to show how to inject noise into current(u) and
# voltage(v) variable. This tutorial creates two compartments, one each in two
# different cores, and injects noise into u for compartment 0 of core 0 and into
# v for compartment 0 of core 1. In order to demonstrate noise injection, we are
# going to create probes to monitor u field of compartment 0 of core0 and v field of
# compartment 0 of core1.

    #   threshold is vThMant*(2^6) = 1000*2^6 = 64000

    #   be driven by a bias current alone.  See user guide for all possible
    #   phases.
