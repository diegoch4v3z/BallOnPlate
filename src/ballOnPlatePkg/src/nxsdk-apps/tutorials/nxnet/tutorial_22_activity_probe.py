# Tutorial: tutorial_22_activity_probe.py
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This tutorial demonstrates how to set up activity probes to monitor spikes.
# The SDK offers spike probes which execute faster and are easier to set up
# but are limited by the available spike counters limited by the number of spike
# counters per chip. Per chip we offer around 2400 counters. As a workaround for the
# limited number of spike counters per chip, activity probes can be used instead.
# Since the update of the compartment activity variable is bound to the threshold
# homeostasis feature, threshold homeostasis must be enabled. In order to prevent
# the actual threshold to change the homeostasisGain parameter must be set to zero.
# In addition, since the activity variable is modeled as a spike trace, its decay
# time constant must be set to a large value for it to act as a spike counter.

    # -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    # vThMant: Threshold voltage of the compartment.
    # enableHomeostasis: enableHomeostasis determines whether vThMant gets updated via activity
    #                    driven threshold homeostasis.
    # minActivity: minActivity is the lower threshold below which vThMant gets decreased to
    #              increase the compartment activity.
    # maxActivity: maxActivity is the upper threshold above which vThMant gets increased to
    #              reduce the compartment activity
    # homeostasisGain: homeostasisGain controls how strongly vThMant gets modified by activity
    #                  leaving the range defined by minActivity, maxActivity.
    # activityImpulse: activitiyImpulse specifies the amount by which activity increases for
    #                  each compartment spike.
    # activityTimeConstant: Decay time constant by which activity decays approximately exponentially
    #                       over time.
    # For activity counter to be used as spike counter, enableHomeostasis should be set to 1 and
    # homeostasisGain should be set to 0 as we are not really using homeostasis. For the activity
    # counter to accumulate spike values, the activityTimeConstant should be set to really high value.
