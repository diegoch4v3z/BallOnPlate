This tutorial demonstrates using ROS publisher/subscriber nodes with host snips.

Pre-requisites:

1. Install ROS. Follow: ROS_INSTALLATION_AND_SETUP.md

2. Start roscore by running: source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash; roscore
    Ensure it comes up (This will block the terminal - so you need another terminal to run this tutorial)

3. source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash

4. On your machine, ensure you have CMake to build the host snip as we need to create the shared library with linkages
   to ros libs

Tutorial is intended to currently run on Kapohobay based setup. Minor modifications to CMakeLists.txt and ros setup
would be required in other scenarios.

Scenario:

Tutorial code is adapted from http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/WritingPublisherSubscriber%28c%2B%2B%29

In this tutorial, we create the following pipeline:

PubSubProcess (HostSnip) --------------->input channel---------------> EmbeddedSnip runMgmt (read from channel)
 subscribes to TOPIC example                                               |
        ^                                                                  |
        |                                                                  V
        |                                                                Update
        |                                                                  |
        |                                                                  |
 publishes to TOPIC example                                                V
PubSubProcess (HostSnip) <---------------feedback channel<------------- EmbeddedSnip runMgmt (write to channel)

We create a concurrent host snip with class PubSubProcess which implements both subscriber and publisher.

PubSubProcess writes an integer into the input channel. EmbeddedSnip reads it and increments the same.
It then writes the incremented value to the feedback channel. PubSubProcess reads this integer.
_pub within PubSubProcess then publishes this to ros topic "example". _sub within PubSubProcess receives the data
by subscribing to the same topic
