# Tutorial: tutorial_19b_soma_traces_spike_injection_snip.py
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This tutorial introduces soma traces and will demonstrate how they work and
# how to configure them. We configure 1 compartment on 6 different cores
# driven by input spikes. 6 different cores are needed because\
# this tutorial demonstrates the usage of time constants and epoch time steps
# and these values are shared for each compartment per core.
# We inject four spikes to the compartment (here at timesteps
#  5, 25, 45 and 65) using a spike injection SNIP and channel.
# The thresholds are setup that each input spike elicits a spike of the
# compartment. The trace of the current, spikes and soma for different
# time constants is probed.
