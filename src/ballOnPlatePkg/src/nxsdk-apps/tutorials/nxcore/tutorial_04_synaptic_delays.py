#
# This tutorial introduces synaptic delays and will demonstrate how they work and
# how to configure them. We configure five compartments driven by an input
# spike generator. The first compartment is connected to four other compartments
# through four synapses - each with a different synaptic delay.
# We inject three spikes to the first compartment (here at timesteps 5, 15, and 30).
# The first synapse has no synpatic delay, while the second,
# third, and fourth synapses have 12, 28, and 62 timestep delays respectively
# (these numbers are randomly chosen for illustration purposes).
# This tutorial also details the configuration of the balance between the
# synaptic delay precision and the number of dendritic compartments.

    # Since i=0 is chosen for this example, cxMetaState[0] with phase0

    # buckets is 2**delayBits-1 and the number of addressable compartments
    # is 2**(13-delayBits), thus the number of accumulators is 2**13.
    # As you allocate more bits for the delay
    # precision, there are less bits to address the dendritic compartment.

    # to 63 delay buckets per compartment and 2**7(128) compartments.
    # A delayBits value of 0 is interpreted as 1 and 7 is interpreted as
