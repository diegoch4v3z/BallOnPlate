#
# This tutorial introduces a box synapse. Instead of an exponentially
# decaying post synaptic response after receiving a spike, we want to
# have a box response, i.e. a constant post synaptic current for a
# specified amount of time. To achieve this we set the decayU to zero,
# add the weight at t and subtract the weight at t+dly. We will
# reuse the synapses[i].dly as the box length instead of the synaptic delay.
# In order to illustrate the box synapse we configure two synapses,
# one as a default synapse with a synaptic delay of 7 (please refer to
# the synaptic delays tutorial for more details) and one as a box
# synapse with a box length of 7.

    # The configuration below uses cxProfileCfg[0] and vthProfileCfg[0] to
    # configure the compartment prototype.  The compartments that are used
    # are also indices 0, 1, 2 i.e. cxCfg[0],...,cxCfg[2].

    # Since i=0 is chosen for this example, cxMetaState[0] is used.
    # There are 4 comparments per compartment group within one cxMetaState.
    # The 4 compartments are distinguished by phase0, phase1, phase2
    # and phase3. The setting of the phases to 2 (PHASE_IDLE) allows the
    # compartment to be driven by an input spike.

    # maximum number of addressable compartments. The number of delay
    # buckets is 2**delayBits-1 and the number of addressable compartments
    # is 2**(13-delayBits), thus the number of accumulators is 2**13.
    # As you allocate more bits for the delay
    # precision, there are less bits to address the dendritic compartment.
    # For example, here we configure the delayBits to be 6, giving us up
    # to 63 delay buckets per compartment and 2**7(128) compartments.
    # A delayBits value of 0 is interpreted as 1 and 7 is interpreted as
