# This tutorial introduces soma traces and will demonstrate how they work and
# how to configure them. We configure 1 compartment on 6 different cores
# driven by an input spike generator. 6 different cores are needed because\
# this tutorial demonstrates the usage of time constants and epoch time steps
# and this values are shared for each compartment per core.
# We inject four spikes to the compartment (here at timesteps
#  5, 25, 45 and 65). The thresholds are setup that each input spike from the
# spike generator elicits a spike of the compartment. The trace of the
# current, spikes and soma for different time constants is probed.
