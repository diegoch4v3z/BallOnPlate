This tutorial demonstrates using yarp ports with host snips.

Pre-requisites:

1. Install yarp. Follow: http://www.yarp.it/install_yarp_linux.html
    1.a For Ubuntu Focal: sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://www.icub.org/ubuntu focal contrib/science" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/icub.list'
    1.b sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 57A5ACB6110576A6
    1.c sudo apt-get update
    1.d sudo apt-get install yarp

2. Start yarpserver by running: yarpserver
    Ensure it comes up

3. On your machine, ensure you have CMake to build the host snip as we need to create the shared library with linkages
   to yarp libs

Tutorial is intended to currently run on Kapohobay based setup. Minor modifications to CMakeLists.txt and yarp setup
would be required in other scenarios.

Scenario:

Tutorial code is adapted from http://www.yarp.it/yarp_cmake_hello.html

In this tutorial, we create the following pipeline:

InputProcess (HostSnip) --------------->input channel---------------> EmbeddedSnip runMgmt (read from channel)
 reads /hello/in                                                           |
        ^                                                                  |
        |                                                                  V
        |                                                                Update
        |                                                                  |
        |                                                                  |
 writes /hello/out                                                         V
FeedbackProcess (HostSnip) <---------------feedback channel<------------- EmbeddedSnip runMgmt (write to channel)

In the Host Snip, we connect the yarp output and input ports
yarp.connect(outPort->getName(), inPort->getName());

InputProcess writes an integer into the input channel. EmbeddedSnip reads it and increments the same.
It then writes the incremented value to the feedback channel. Feedback process reads this integer.
Feedback process then writes this integer onto yarp /hello/out. InputProcess receives the data by reading yarp /hello/in

Please note: InputProcess and FeedbackProcess execute on every timestep. InputProcess is a PreExecution Snip
while FeedbackProcess is a PostExecutionSnip
