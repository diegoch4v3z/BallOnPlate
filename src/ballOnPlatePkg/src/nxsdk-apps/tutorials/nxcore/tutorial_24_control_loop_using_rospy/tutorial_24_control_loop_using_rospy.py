"""Tutorial demonstrates implementing a simple control loop using rospy
We use the python rospy from rospkg module here to publish and subscribe to a topic

Prerequisites:

    0. Follow pre-requisites in tutorial_23_host_snips_with_ros_integration
    1. ROS Imports: `pip3 install rospkg pyyaml catkin-pkg`
    2. source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
    3. Start ros core on a separate terminal: `source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash; roscore`

How to observe throughput from terminal:

 - rostopic hz /example
   - display publishing rate of topic
 - rostopic echo /example
   - print messages to screen

ROSPY API Documentation: http://docs.ros.org/api/rospy/html/

Scenario:

In this tutorial, we create the following pipeline:

InputProcess ------------------------>input channel---------------> EmbeddedSnip runMgmt (read from channel)
 subscribes to TOPIC example                                               |
        ^                                                                  |
        |                                                                  V
        |                                                                Update
        |                                                                  |
        |                                                                  |
 publishes to TOPIC example                                                V
FeedbackProcess  <-------------------feedback channel<------------- EmbeddedSnip runMgmt (write to channel)

Note: For lower latency, host snips could be explored.
