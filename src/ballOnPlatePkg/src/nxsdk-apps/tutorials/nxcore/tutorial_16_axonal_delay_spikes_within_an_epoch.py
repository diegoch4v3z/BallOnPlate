# Tutorial: tutorial_16_axonal_delay_spikes_within_an_epoch.py
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This tutorial illustrates the impact of the tepoch setting when axonal_delay
# is enabled.  We configure two independent compartments each connected to a
# separate compartment through a synapse. We set the same axonal delay for each
# compartment. For the first pair of compartments, the v threshold is set low
# enough such that two spikes are generated within tepoch.  The second spike
# is thus lost and is not sent to the connected compartment.  The second pair
# of compartments enable refractory delay and thus eliminate the occurrence of
# a second spike within tepoch.  In general, refractory delay is recommended
# to be set to tepoch.
