# # Direct Trace Injection
#
# For learning, a synapse only has access to its own parameters (weight, delay, tag) and its pre- and post-synaptic traces. Some applications may need an external signal to use during training, such as a global error signal. This tutorial shows how a snip can be used to overwrite postsynaptic traces with values provided from python.
#
# A snip will be used to overwrite trace values of the postsynaptic compartments just before learning executes. The list of new trace values will be provided by the superhost over a channel at every learning update.
#
# ![Direct Trace Injection](../figures/jupyter_snips.png)
#
# ## The steps in this tutorial are:
# 1. Setup the network as usual
# 2. Create an instance of the *direct_trace_injection* class, passing the constructor the compartment group to be overwritten
# 3. Compile the network as usual
# 4. Call the *setupSnips()* function of the *direct_trace_injection* instance to prepare the snips for execution
# 5. Start the board driver as usual
# 6. Call the *sendSnipInitialization()* function of the *direct_trace_injection* instance to send the initialization data to the snip
# 7. Run the board with the *aSync=True* argument to make the call non-blocking
# 8. At each learning epoch, call the *write_y()* function of the direct_trace_injection instance, passing a list of y trace values to be written to the compartment group
#

# ## 1. Setup the Network
#
# ### Setup the compartments
# In our case we will just create a single group of compartments called cx.
#
# However, if we wanted to overwrite traces of arbitrary compartments in a network, we can put those compartments together in a group (a compartment can belong to many groups).
#
# For example:
# ~~~~
# cx=net.createCompartmentGroup()
# cx.addCompartments(compartment1) #add existing compartment1 to the group
# cx.addCompartments(compartment2) #add existing compartment2 to the group
# cx.addCompartments(compartment3) #add existing compartment3 to the group
# cx.addCompartments(compartmentGroup1[n]) #add the nth compartment (index starts at 0) of compartmentGroup1 to the group
# ~~~~
#
# We can then modify the traces of all compartments in cx. Note that adding a compartment to a group does not change the network structure unless you explicitly connect something to that group or modify some properties of the group.

    # Compartment group parameters
    vThMant = 50
    compartmentCurrentDecay = int(1/5*2**12)
    compartmentVoltageDecay = int(1/10*2**12)

    # Compartment prototype
    # We do not need to enable the trace computation (enableSpikeBackprop) because we'll be explicitly overwriting the trace values
    # with our snip
    cxProto = nx.CompartmentPrototype(vThMant=vThMant,
                                      compartmentCurrentDecay=compartmentCurrentDecay,
                                      compartmentVoltageDecay=compartmentVoltageDecay
                                      )

# ### Setup the learning rule and connection
#
# This example only uses the y1 trace, but y2 and y3 traces can also be used.
# Overwriting the y1 trace also requires overwriting the y2 and y3 traces. We cannot mix injected traces with traces computed by the compartment itself.
#
# The learning rule here does not use x1 or x2, but there is no reason not to (try it).
# Since we do not use x1 or x2, we have not set up any x1 or x2 trace parameters.
#
# y1, y2, and y3 trace computation parameters do not need to be set because we will overwrite any computed values.
#
# y1 must always be positive, but using a bracketed term (y1-64) allows us to inject errors ranging from -64 to +63 by varying y1 from 0 to 127
# ~~~
# dw = 'u0*(y1-64)-u0*w'
# ~~~
# has the effect
# ~~~
# w = 'u0*(y1-64)'
# ~~~
# i.e. previous values of w do not affect the current value

    dw = 'u0*(y1-64)-u0*w'

#

    # inter spike interval

    # define the synaptic weights connecting the spike generator to the post synaptic-learning compartment
    weight = np.array([np.linspace(-64, 0, numTrainNeurons, endpoint=True)]).T

    connLearn = sgDataIn.connect(cx,
                                 prototype=connProto,
                                 weight=weight
                                 )
