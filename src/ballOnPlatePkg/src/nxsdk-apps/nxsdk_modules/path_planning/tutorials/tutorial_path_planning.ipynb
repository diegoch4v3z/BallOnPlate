The algorithm infers associations between neurons in a network from the asymmetric effects of STDP on a propagating sequence of spikes.\n",

    "Consider a path planning problem where an autonomous agent is given a map of an environment and is required to plan paths to destination locations within it. The map is encoded in the spiking network of where neurons represent map locations and synaptic connections represent spatial associations between them. The path between the current location of the agent and one of the specified destinations can be found by propagating a spike wave from the destination and issuing motion commands in the direction of the local synaptic vector. Thus to navigate to the destination after a spike wave propagates, the agent localizes itself with sensory cues, reads the path encoded in the local synaptic vector and\n",
