    "# Read Lakemont Spike Count\n",
    "This tutorial illustrates the use of spike probes to capture the spikes count from lakemont via SNIP. Normally spike probe involves frequent interaction between host and Lakmont on chip, which could slow down the application while host keeps on reading out spike information from Lakemont then sending it back to spike probe. In situation when we want spikes count to be returned as soon as possible, we can use SNIP to read out spikes count register directly from Lakmont through a channel, rather than relying on the spike probe returned from host. \n",
