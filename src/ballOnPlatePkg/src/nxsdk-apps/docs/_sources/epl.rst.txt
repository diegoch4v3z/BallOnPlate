EPL
###

The EPL module provides functionality to setup, train and test a neuromorphic
algorithm for one-shot pattern learning inspired by the
External Plexiform Layer (EPL) network of the mammalian olfactory bulb.
While the algorithm implemented by the network learns to recognize "odors"
(more precisely, using odor chemosensor array data), it can be used to learn
any other patterns as the EPL network basically implements a spatio-temporal
attractor (STA) network. After the EPL/STA network "learns" an odor/pattern,
even if a noise corrupted version of the learned pattern (test sample) is
presented, the network activity settles down into the attractor state of the
learned pattern.

The module provides a EPLMultiPatternLearning class to setup, train, test
and evaluate the performance of a one-shot learning algorithm.
