The Single Layer Image Classifier (SLIC) module provides functions to build one layer neural network for image
classification. The images for SLIC can be grayscale images stored as a numpy array. SLIC module provides function to
preprocess grayscale images into binary images, which drive linescan engine to generate spikes that are further
processed by Loihi. Both the image data and the corresponding labels are needed to train the network.
