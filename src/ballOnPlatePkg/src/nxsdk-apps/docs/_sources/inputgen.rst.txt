Basic Spike Generator
=====================
Within the Nx SDK, we provide you with a basic spike generator. The code snippet below provides some guidance on how to use it.

.. code-block:: python

   # Generate an input spike at timestep 5 to chip 0, core 4 and axon 0
   bs       = BasicSpikeGenerator(board)
   timestep = 5
   chipId   = 0
   coreId   = 4
   axonId   = 0
   bs.addSpike(timestep, chipId, coreId, axonId)
