Working with Probes
===================
Probes enable you to see how the network changes over time. To create a probe, you first create a monitor (see :doc:`coremonitor`) and then establish either a u probe, a v probe or a spike probe on the compartment(s) you wish to monitor. Here's a simple code snippet (which you will find in most tutorials) to get you started:

.. code-block:: python

   uProbe = mon.probe(n2Core.cxState, [0], 'u')[0]
   
   fig = plt.figure(1001)

   plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
   uProbe.plot()
   plt.title('u')
