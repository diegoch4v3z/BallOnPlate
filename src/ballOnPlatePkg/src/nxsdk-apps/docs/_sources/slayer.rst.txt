SLAYER Module 
##############

The SLAYER module provides NxSDK helper functions for running a SLAYER-trained
model on Loihi. The SLAYER training code for Loihi is separate and can be obtained 
from https://github.com/bamsumit/slayerPytorch, but the training code is not 
required in order to run SLAYER models on Loihi. Pre-trained SLAYER models can 
be found at https://github.com/bamsumit/slayerLoihiModelZoo and are automatically
downloaded by the tutorials.


The module contains functions to implement pooling, convolution, and fully 
connected layers. At the moment, model partitioning is a manual process where
the user must specify layerwise how many compartments to put on each core.

The module also contains snips and functions to help with efficiently injecting 
spikes into the model and for observing the output spike rates for each sample.

The NMNIST and DVS Gesture tutorials show how to run and test SLAYER models.


Spike Injection
###############

Spike injection is done with custom snips. An assumption is made that all input
compartment lie on the first chip, which removes the need to communicate to lakemonts
which chip each spike must be routed to, thus saving on communication time.

Spike injection can optionally be split across up to 3 lakemonts to share the load.

The current form of the model precomputes all input spikes before the run starts, 
but a user could also specify their own spikes on-the-fly.


Spike Output
############

A lakemont snip is used to count spikes from the output layer and only return the 
aggregate result at the end of each sample. This saves channel communication and 
helps to accelerate testing. 

If precise spike times are desired, the user can replace the dummy probes and 
counter reading with spike probes attached to the output layer.
