Spike Streamer Module
=====================

The Spike Input Streamer provides a means to inject spikes into a model at 
deterministic times while the model is running on Loihi. Similarly, the 
Spike Output Streamer provides a way to receive spike from a model while it 
is running. Together these features allows a model to be programmed to Loihi 
before specifying the input spikes. The user can then send spikes to the model 
and receive spikes from the model in an online fashion.


Spike Input Streamer
--------------------

The Spike Input Streamer requires spikes to be provided in chronological order. 
Whenever enough spikes have been provided to fill a packet, that packet is sent 
to a SNIP which performs the spike injection and a new packet is started. The user 
can also flush a partial packet to the SNIP at any time.

The SNIP will always advance Loihi time up until the time of the most recent spike 
specified by the user (see tutorials).

The Spike Input Streamer also provides a function for advancing chip time in the 
absence of spikes (see tutorials).


Spike Output Streamer
---------------------

The Spike Output Streamer provides a way to monitor the output spikes from a 
network at fixed intervals. For example, it can return the cumulative spike count 
for each output neuron every 100 timesteps (configurable).
