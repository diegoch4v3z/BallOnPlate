NxNet: Refractory Delays
=========================

Motivation
----------
Refractory delays are a key aspect of any spiking neuron. Refactory delays enable you to control the rate at which a neuron can send a spike by imposing a delay after a spike is sent down the axon and before the neuron's voltage can again accumulate a charge.
