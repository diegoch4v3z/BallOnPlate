NxCore: Membrane Potential Threshold
====================================

Motivation
----------
Within this tutorial, you will learn 2 different ways to set the v threshold. To use the built-in homeostasis feature, you need to use the v threshold setting directly within the soma state. This allows you to set a discrete voltage threshold (Vth) per compartment. Additionally, if you need a large variety of Vth per compartment, the soma state's Vth parameter is a great option. Otherwise, we recommend (for ease of use and performance) to just use the vthProfileCfg's setting.
