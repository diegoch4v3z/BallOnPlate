LCA
###

The LCA module can be used to solve the constraint LASSO optimization problem
implemented by a spiking neural network as described in:
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.05475.pdf
which minimizes the following objective function:
argmin_a |x - D'*a|**2 + lambda*|a|_1
where 'x' is the input, 'D' is a dictionary matrix, 'a' is a sparse code and
'lambda" is a regularization factor. _1 denotes an L1 norm.

The module provides the LcaNet class which represents the neural network to
solve the sparse coding problem as well as a number of helper classes.
